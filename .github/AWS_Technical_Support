# AWS Technical Support
### Business Support Plan
- The Business Support plan is specifically designed for users who need rapid and comprehensive support. This plan ensures access to AWS technical support within one hour. It includes 24/7 phone, email, and chat support for critical issues, meaning businesses can receive timely assistance when they need it most. Additionally, this plan provides support for third-party applications, offers best practice recommendations, and proactively monitors AWS infrastructure. By opting for the Business Support plan, businesses can achieve a balance between cost and level of service, ensuring that their operational needs are met without the higher cost of the Enterprise plan.

### Basic Support Plan
- The Basic Support plan provides very limited support options, such as 24/7 customer service, access to documentation, whitepapers, and support forums. It does not include access to technical support engineers. Therefore, it is not suitable for businesses that require urgent technical assistance.

### Developer Support Plan
- The Developer Support plan is slightly more advanced than the Basic plan, offering business day access to support for technical issues but only guarantees a response time of 12-24 hours based on severity. This plan is geared toward non-mission critical workloads and lacks immediacy and comprehensiveness.

### Enterprise Support Plan
- The Enterprise Support plan provides the highest level of support, including access to a Technical Account Manager, concierge support, and faster response times across all issues. While it does provide technical support within an hour, the cost associated with this plan is significantly higher and may not be justified for many businesses, making it less cost-effective compared to the Business plan.
